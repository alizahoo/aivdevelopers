# Which Tech Stacks Lead to the Best Salaries in 2024?

## Project Overview
This project explores the **Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024** dataset to determine which programming languages, frameworks, databases, and cloud platforms correlate with the highest salaries. The analysis follows the **CRISP-DM** process, including **exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling** to predict salary outcomes based on tech stacks.

## Motivation
With the rapid evolution of technology, developers often wonder:
- Which programming languages and frameworks lead to the best salaries?
- Do cloud platforms or databases significantly impact earnings?
- What combination of tech stacks maximizes earning potential?

This project aims to answer these questions using real-world data and machine learning predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024**. It includes responses from thousands of developers worldwide, covering various aspects such as technologies used, job satisfaction, salary, and work preferences.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries were used for data analysis, visualization, and modeling:
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computations
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning modeling and evaluation
- **xgboost**: Advanced regression modeling for salary prediction

## Files in This Repository
- **README.md**: Overview of the project and methodology.
- **survey_results_public.csv**: The dataset (not included in the repo but referenced in the notebook).
- **tech_stack_salary_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and machine learning implementation.

## Summary of Findings
- Certain programming languages (e.g., Rust, Go, Kotlin) show a higher average salary compared to others.
- Cloud technologies like AWS and Google Cloud significantly impact salary potential.
- Full-stack developers using modern frameworks tend to earn more than those using outdated stacks.
- A machine learning model was trained to predict salary based on a developer's tech stack, with reasonable accuracy.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to **Stack Overflow** for making the dataset publicly available.
- Inspiration from various data science blogs and community discussions.

## Next Steps
- Further refine the model with additional features like job roles and experience levels.
- Expand analysis to include geographical trends in tech salaries.
