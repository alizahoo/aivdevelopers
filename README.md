# README: Job Satisfaction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores **job satisfaction** by analyzing factors such as **salary, remote work, and employment type**. We use **data visualization and machine learning** to uncover insights and predict job satisfaction levels. The goal is to answer key workplace-related questions: *Does salary guarantee happiness? Does remote work make employees more satisfied? Can we predict job satisfaction based on these factors?*

Spoiler alert: It's complicated! But let's dive in.

## 🔍 Summary of Findings

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Salary does not guarantee job satisfaction** – Some high earners were still unhappy!
- **Remote workers tend to report higher satisfaction**, but not everyone thrives in isolation.
- **Higher education does not strongly correlate with satisfaction** – More degrees don’t necessarily mean more happiness.
- **Employment type influences satisfaction** – Full-time employees often reported higher satisfaction, but some freelancers were equally happy due to flexibility.

### 🔹 Machine Learning Results
- **Models struggled to predict job satisfaction accurately.**
- Logistic Regression had an accuracy of **0.24**, and Random Forest performed even worse at **0.18**.
- **Why?** Job satisfaction is complex and influenced by multiple unmeasured factors (company culture, management, work-life balance, etc.).
- **Takeaway:** Salary and remote work are just pieces of the puzzle—predicting happiness requires more nuanced data.
