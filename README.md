# Which Skills Make Developers Most Employable in 2024?

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 dataset to identify the most valuable technical and soft skills for employability in the tech industry. Using the CRISP-DM framework, we explore data trends, clean the dataset, build a machine learning model, and derive insights to help developers optimize their career paths.

## Motivation
The tech job market is constantly evolving, and understanding which skills lead to better job opportunities can help developers make informed learning and career decisions. This project aims to:
- Identify the most in-demand programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
- Analyze the impact of education and certifications on employment.
- Use machine learning to predict employability based on skills and experience.

## Repository Contents
- **notebooks/** – Contains the Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and machine learning implementation.
- **data/** – Includes the cleaned and processed dataset (if applicable).
- **images/** – Visualizations and plots used in the analysis.
- **README.md** – Project overview, setup instructions, and key findings.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Summary of Findings
- The most in-demand programming languages in 2024 are X, Y, and Z.
- Soft skills such as communication and teamwork play a crucial role in employability.
- Developers with experience in cloud technologies and AI tools have higher salaries.
- A CS degree is beneficial but not always necessary; bootcamps and self-learning are viable alternatives.
